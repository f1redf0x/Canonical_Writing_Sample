# Canonical Writing Sample Project
This is sample documentation to show how I use the diataxis framework to construct tutorials, How-To Guides, References, and Explanations. In this case, I will be summarizing the video "Using WireGuard for Hub and Spoke Site-to-Site VPN" from Youtuber, "LinuxCloudHacks" to show my skills at documentation. 

I use the Vanilla Framework and Markdown for the construction of these documents and I'm open to continuing to modify these examples should that be requested.

# About this Sample

The following set of articles represent an attempt at writing a Canonical Styled article under the following conditions:

* Shows an understanding of the [diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) model of documentation.

* Adheres to the [style guide](https://docs.ubuntu.com/styleguide/en).

* Covers a fairly complex topic, like [site-to-site vpn configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CbFG_4BInk) to show that I understand technical concepts.
